# FEWD - Project 1 - Rachel
 My Personal Profile Page

 For this project, I was given a personal profile webpage to practice basic HTML and CSS skills. I had to customize the page with my own photos and information. I also had to use CSS to change colors, add animations, and improve the look of the page. 

 I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to further expand on the project by creating an additonal page to expand on this online profile, edit the styling of the profile photo's CSS properties like transtion and transform, add more photos and imagery to the page, and add more text to the page like a list of my hobbies. 

 Broswers tested for compatibility:

 1. Chrome
 2. Firefox
 3. Edge

 Grade: Meets Expectations
