# My Personal Profile Page

In this project, I was given a personal profile webpage to practice basic HTML and CSS skills. I had to customize the page with my own photos and information. I also had to use CSS to change colors, add animations, and improve the look of the page. The CSS properties used for styling the profile photo were transform and transition. 

I further added two pages; experience.html and hobbies.html.
